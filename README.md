# manjaro-arm-installer

[WIP] Scripts for installing Manjaro ARM directly to SD/eMMC cards without the need for images.

**Disclaimer:**
This script is very early days. It *will* destroy your hosts partitions when used.

It cleared out my /boot/efi partition at least.

So I will be putting this project o hold for now.
